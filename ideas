APP WITH GURKIRAT: 

CHATGPT+ ALGORITHMIC TRADING FOR CUSTOMERS + SHARES 
Note that Shares is not in the US. If any one of you have work visa, he can do this (I mean he can legally sell the app in the US). The only problem with creating an app is that we cannot legally sell it in the US, so what is the point of doing it? I do not know if this idea would hold anywhere else? Would this hold in India or Turkey?  Maybe I can take 6 months off to go to Turkey and start this business, once we have a good product. 




Hackathon ideas: 
	- An advanced search tool for PDF search.

		- "" gives a hard search (exact phrase should be included), whereas include a '' option for soft search, that 			displays phrases that are similar to that search phrase or have similar semantic meaning to them 


 - Word document that lets you talk instead of writing, assists you with writing. Very smart, goes from line to line, understands what you mean. For instance you will say: 
"Siri, go to line 5, and cut remove the word "some word" from the line 5. Then, it understands the command and goes and removes line 5 from the document. 
- Can you extend it for it to use the computer for yourself, instead of fucking using the keyboard. For instance: "Siri, open the chrome, go to the tab where I have the canvas open". Then she will reply : "There is no canvas tab" . Then you say: "Okay, then open one canvas tab" opens the canvas tab for you. Then you say : "scroll down to machine learning 5806 and hit click" , scrolls down, enters that page.
